## Installation

This app uses inquirer.js, mysql2, console.table, and comma-number. Run `npm install` in the root directory to download these dependencies. Since it interacts with a SQL database, a SQL interface is also required. The user will need to enter their MySQL username and password in `index.js` to connect to their local database to run this application.

## Usage

First, download the schema.sql file to create the database and three tables that contain the info for departments, roles, and employees. A seeds.sql file is included as an example. You can seed the database by following the prompts and/or by running `mysql -u root -p` and `source seeds.sql` to see the seeded data.
